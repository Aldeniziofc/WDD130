     <footer><h2>hope that everyone can understand</h2>  that there is not a
         “perfect prayer.” We do not have to follow a specific kind
          of pattern or verbiage. The one thing that is required is
           the heart—the real desire to receive what the Lord would
            have us receive. <strong>commitment to act on His</strong>  promptings
             is what really draws forth His voice and His direction.
